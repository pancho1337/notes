1) This worked for me. First, create a new user. Example: User foo with password bar

> mysql> CREATE USER 'foo'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'bar';
2) Replace the below code with a username with 'foo'.

> mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON database_name.* TO'foo'@'localhost';
Note: database_name is the database that you want to have privileges, . means all on all

3) Login as user foo

mysql> mysql -u foo -p
Password: bar

4) Make sure your initial connection from Sequelize is set to foo with pw bar.
